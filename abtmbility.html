      What is CPS for EV?

      A new generation of systems with integrated computational and physical capabilities that can communicate with people via a variety of new modalities is referred to as cyber-physical systems (CPS). 
      Future technological advancements will be greatly aided by our ability to interact with the physical environment and enhance its capabilities through computing,communication,and control.The design
      and development of next-generation electric vehicle and hybrid gas-electric cars,completely autonomous city driving, and prosthetics that enable brain impulses to opera actual objects are examples 
      of opportunities and research problems.Although, there is lot of scope of CPS in EV but still this topic need a much deeper research to overcome the challenges by CPS with EV integration.The integ
      ration of CPS with EV research is still in its early stages. Professional and institutional barriers have led to the creation of academic research and education spaces that are strictly defined 
      discipline-specific. Separate sub-disciplines of research, including as sensors, networking and communications, control theory, mathematical concepts, software engineering, and computer science, 
      are studied separately. Figure 2, shows the challenges associated with EV-CPS.
